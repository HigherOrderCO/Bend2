-- The Adjust module post-processes a parsed term, preparing it for
-- type-checking, evaluation and compilation. It has 4 steps:
-- - FlattenPats: makes all pattern-matches flat and single-scrutinee
-- - DesugarPats: converts pattern-matches into core lambda-matches
-- - DesugarFrks: converts forks into sups and dups
-- - ReduceEtas: turns `位x.(位{f} x)` into `位{f}` (case-tree form)
-- Note that, per convention, top-level defs must be shaped as case trees,
-- without expressions in the `(位{f} x)` form. After these passes, there can
-- still be expressions in these shapes (non-var scrutinees, let-bindings...).
-- These are then split into separate top-level defs by the type-checker.
