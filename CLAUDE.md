# Bend2

This repository implements the Bend2 language.

It is structured as follows:

- bend.cabal: the cabal file. Bend doesn't use stack.
  - Build this project with `cabal build`.
  - Run with `bend file.bend`.
  - When debugging, run with:
    `cabal run -v0 bend --project-dir=PATH_TO_BEND2_DIR -- FILE_NAME OPTIONS`
    This is faster than rebuilding and running.

- src/Core/Type.hs: most important file, always read. Includes every type used in
  this repo, including the Term type for Bend's core language.

- src/Core/WHNF.hs: evaluates a term to weak head normal form. Includes all
  computation rules of the interpreter.

- src/Core/Check.hs: bidirectional type-checker for Bend terms and proofs.

- src/Core/Equal.hs: equality between terms. Used by the checker.

- src/Core/Rewrite.hs: rewrites an expression by another. Used by the checker.

- src/Core/Bind.hs: binds named variables to native Î»'s (HOAS). Used after parsing.

- src/Core/Flatten.hs: converts generalized pattern-matches to native eliminators
  (case-of). Used after parsing.

- src/Core/Adjust.hs: flattens and binds in topological order. Used after parsing.

- src/Core/CLI.hs: Bend's command-line interface.

- src/Core/Import.hs: auto-import feature. Used by the CLI.

- src/Core/Deps.hs: collects all external dependencies of a term. Used by the CLI.

- src/Core/Parse.hs: parser type, commons and utils (lexeme, keywords, etc.).

- src/Core/Parse/Term.hs: all core term parsers (lambdas, pairs, numbers, etc.).

- src/Core/Parse/Book.hs: top-level persers (def, type, import, etc.).

- src/Core/Parse/WithSpan.hs: temporary hack to improve errors (not important).

- src/Target/JavaScript.hs: compiles Bend files to JavaScript modules.

- app/Main.hs: entry point for the CLI.

- examples/prompt.bend: concise file designed to quickly learn the syntax

- examples/main.bend: many random examples

- docs/syntax.md: longer syntax guide for humans (AIs prefer prompt.bend)

- docs/inductive-datatypes.md: how are inductive types encoded? (A: via "Fording")

## Testing

The Bend2 test framework is located in the `test/` directory:

- test/Main.hs: test runner that finds and executes all test files
- test/Test.hs: testing framework module with assertions and utilities
- test/tests/: directory containing test files
- test/README.md: comprehensive testing documentation

To run tests:
- All tests: `cabal test`
- Single test: `runhaskell -i:test test/tests/BasicTest.hs`

### Test Style Convention

Tests follow a specific format convention:

1. **Test File Naming**: Each test file in `test/tests/` is a unit test
   - Name pattern for type-checking tests: `check_<function_name>.hs` (tests if function checks and computes correctly)
   - Name pattern for error tests: descriptive names like `mismatch_bool_nat.hs`
   - Examples: `check_id.hs`, `check_add.hs`, `mismatch_bool_nat.hs`

2. **Canonical Test File Structure** (for type-checking tests):
```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE MultilineStrings #-}

import Test

-- Each top-level Haskell definition represents a virtual .bend file
-- Convention: use <name>_bend for definitions (e.g., id_bend represents "id.bend")
id_bend :: String
id_bend = """
def id<A>(x: A) -> A:
  x

-- Include inline tests using Bend equalities
-- Convention: T0, T1, T2... for test names
def T0 : Nat{3n == id<Nat>(3n)} = {==}
def T1 : Bool{True == id<Bool>(True)} = {==}
def T2 : Nat{0n == id<Nat>(id<Nat>(0n))} = {==}
def T3 : String{"hello" == id<String>("hello")} = {==}
"""

main :: IO ()
main = testFileChecks id_bend
```

3. **Test Functions Available**:
   - `testFileChecks`: Alias for tests that just need to type-check (checks that `err == ""`)
   - `testFile`: Full test function when you need to check stdout/stderr explicitly
   - `test`: Most general function for testing multiple files

Key conventions:
- Use top-level string definitions for Bend code (not inline strings)
- Name convention: `<name>_bend` represents a virtual `.bend` file within the test
- Include 3-4 inline tests (T0, T1, T2...) within the Bend code to test the function
- Inline tests use Bend equality types: `def T0 : Nat{3n == id<Nat>(3n)} = {==}`
- A file is considered successfully checked when `err == ""`
- For simple type-checking tests, use `testFileChecks` (canonical style)
- For tests that need to verify specific output or errors, use `testFile`

The framework provides:
- `assert`: basic assertions
- `has`: checks if output contains text (ignores ANSI colors and whitespace)
- Colored output showing test results
